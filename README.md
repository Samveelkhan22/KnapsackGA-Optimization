# KnapsackGA-Optimization
This repository contains an implementation of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) applied to the 0/1 Knapsack Problem. The project explores how different genetic algorithm configurations—population sizes, selection methods, crossover, and mutation—affect solution quality and convergence rates.
